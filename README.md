# VIBE: Visual Interactive Build Experience

VIBE (Visual Interactive Build Experience) is a proposal that reimagines software development by centering on visual, architecture-first methodologies and AI-assisted code generation. Rather than requiring deep programming expertise or complex toolchains, VIBE transforms detailed flowcharts into functional applications through a series of well-defined steps. 

By integrating local, open-source AI models and adhering to fully output-agnostic compilation, VIBE fosters a secure, flexible, and collaborative environment. This approach enables architects, technical leads, and even non-coders to focus on high-level logic while retaining granular control over platform choices, UI styling, and performance optimizations.
